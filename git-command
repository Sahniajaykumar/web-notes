✅ Following Steps to upload the project into github : 
==========================================================

1️⃣ Initialized Git 
git init   : : git init initializes an empty Git repository by creating the .git metadata directory.

✔ Repository created correctly

2️⃣ Staged all files
git add .   : All files moved from working directory → staging area

Note: After `git add .` , you will show CRLF / LF Warnings
Meaning:
  1.You are on Windows
  2.Git is warning about line-ending conversion

| OS          | Line Ending |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Windows     | CRLF        |
| Linux/macOS | LF          |


✔ All project files added
⚠ LF → CRLF warnings → harmless on Windows

3️⃣ Verified staging
git status


✔ Files correctly staged
✔ No mistakes

4️⃣ First commit
git commit -m "first commit"

Q: What happened internally?
--> Git created:
            1. A commit object
            2. A tree object
            3. Multiple blob objects

--> The commit now has:
            1. Commit ID: aee1af7
            2. Author
            3. Timestamp
            4. Snapshot of all staged files
✔ Clean root commit
✔ 15 files committed

5️⃣ Set main branch
git branch -M main

Q: What happened?
--> Branch renamed to main
--> -M = force rename

Q: Why this matters:
--> GitHub uses main as default branch


6️⃣ Connected to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sahniajaykumar/card-components.git

Q: What happened?
--> Git stored a remote reference
--> Name: origin
--> URL: GitHub repository

✔ Remote added correctly

7️⃣ Pushed to GitHub
git push -u origin main


Q: What happened?
--> Git packaged commits
--> Sent them to GitHub
--> Created branch main on remote
--> Uploaded all files

📌 -u means: 
--> Set upstream
--> Future git push works without arguments

✔ Push successful
✔ Tracking set up
✔ Repo is live 🚀
=========================================================================================================================================

After deploye project if you want to update some feature in your deployed project then again follow this procedure

2️⃣ Staged all files
git add .

4️⃣ First commit
git commit -m "first commit"                      // anything message

7️⃣ Pushed to GitHub

git push -u origin main

✔ Push successful
