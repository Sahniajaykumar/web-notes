--------------------------------
What is ReactJs ? 
-------------------------------
ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast, scalable, and reusable user interfaces, mainly for single-page applications (SPAs).

React helps us to build UI's declaratively .

React use virtual dom to optimise performance .
  
Instead of manually changing the DOM, React uses a virtual DOM to decide the fastest way to update the page.

 Virtual DOM : 
-------------------------------
React creates a virtual copy of the DOM

When data changes, React:

              Updates the virtual DOM
  
              Compares it with the previous version

              Updates only what changed in the real DOM

This makes React fast and efficient.

-----------------------------------
Why ReactJS was introduced
-----------------------------------
1. Problem with traditional DOM manipulation

Earlier, developers directly updated the real DOM

Frequent DOM updates were slow and inefficient

Complex UIs became hard to manage

➡️ React introduced the Virtual DOM to update only what changes.

2. Difficulty managing large, dynamic UIs

Applications like Facebook had:

Real-time updates

Large amounts of changing data

MVC frameworks became complex and error-prone

➡️ React simplified UI development using components.

---------------------------------
Advantages of ReactJS : 
---------------------------------
High performance due to Virtual DOM

Reusable components

SEO-friendly (with SSR like Next.js)

Large ecosystem and community

--------------------------------
History of ReactJS
---------------------------------
1. Origin at Facebook (2011)

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook

Facebook faced issues managing complex, fast-changing UIs (news feed updates, notifications)

Traditional MVC frameworks were slow and hard to scale

➡️ React was built to solve performance and UI consistency problems

2. First internal use

React was first used internally on Facebook’s News Feed

Later adopted by Instagram

3. Open-sourced (2013)

Facebook open-sourced React in 2013

Initially met with skepticism because of JSX

Gradually gained popularity due to performance and simplicity

4. Introduction of the Virtual DOM

One of React’s biggest innovations

Allowed efficient updates without directly manipulating the real DOM

5. Growth and ecosystem expansion

Community adoption grew rapidly

Tools and libraries emerged:

Redux (state management)

React Router (routing)

Next.js (server-side rendering)

6. Introduction of Hooks (2019)

React 16.8 introduced Hooks

Allowed state and lifecycle features in functional components

Reduced dependency on class components

7. Modern React (Present)

Emphasis on:

Functional components

Hooks

Concurrent rendering

Used by major companies like:

Facebook (Meta)

Netflix

Airbnb

Steps to create a React project using Vite
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Install Node.js
-----------------------
Make sure Node.js is installed:
node -v
npm -v

2. Create a Vite + React project
-----------------------------------------
Run:  
npm create vite@latest

You’ll be prompted to choose:

Project name
Framework → React
Variant → JavaScript or TypeScript

3. Move into project folder
----------------------------
cd project-name

4. Install dependencies
----------------------------
npm install

5. Start the development server
-----------------------------------
npm run dev

Open the browser at:
----------------------
http://localhost:5173

-------------------------------------
Alternative (direct command)
------------------------------------
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react


Or for TypeScript:

npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts

Project structure (important for interviews)
my-react-app/
│── src/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│── index.html
│── package.json
│── vite.config.js

Key files explanation

main.jsx → Entry point

App.jsx → Root component

index.html → Single HTML file

vite.config.js → Vite configuration
